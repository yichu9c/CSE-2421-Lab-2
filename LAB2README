2. It took my about 10-15 hours to complete this lab.

3.Something really interesting was bit shifting, I found what I feel like was a clever way to create the key. I also found out a lot more about preprocessors and the #ifdef thing.

4.I used print return_value and well as disp return_value. It seemed to make a lot of sense, at first it became 0x11, then 0x33, then all the way to 0x66 at the end.
